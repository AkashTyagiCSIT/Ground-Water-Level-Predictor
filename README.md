# Neer Manthan

A mobile application for Ground Water Level Prediction

Using data provided by government sources such as the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and NITI Aayog, my team and I developed an AI-powered mobile application capable of analyzing historical groundwater data and predicting future water levels. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to identify trends and provide location-based insights for sustainable water management. The project was designed to assist policymakers, farmers, and local authorities in making data-driven decisions regarding groundwater conservation.
